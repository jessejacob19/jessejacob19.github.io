What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?
    Padding is the space between the content and the border, padding is transparent and uses the padding tag in css. the unit for padding is usually px (pixels).

    margin is the space outside the border, it seperates your block from other blocks, the big difference between margin and padding is thatmargin does not include background images or background colors.

    border is just as it sounds the border of the text block you can use css to color it and do allsorts.

What are the best practices associated with using classes vs. ids?
    classes and ids are used to do specific modifications in our stylesheets. you use an id when you have something specific to that tag you want to change. you use a class if there is something you want to change in multiple tags.

What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?
    Fixed positioning or (static positioning) is default these elements will stack in a stadard one after another order so in the html what ever comes first will be displayed first and the next element will be below etc. 

    relative positioning moves the element relative to it original static position, there is also a placeholder where the element was originally when it was static. using relative positioning makes elements overlap sometimes.

    absoulute positioning is removed from the dom and is actually positioned by its nearest relatively positioned parent. when you make a element absolute the dom ignores it and can move other elements to where it is.
What does it mean to display inline vs inline blocks?
    block elements are one underneath another.

    inline elements are elements beside each other.
    
    inline block elements are a hybrid element that creates a rectangular region (a block) and doesent create any new lines. a major difference between inline and inline block is that inline block allows you to set width and height of the element.

    inline and block elements are highly related to divs and spans
