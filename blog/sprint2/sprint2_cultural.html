        <h1>Cultural blog Sprint 2</h1>
        <p>My strengths and weaknesses in respect of this learning plan is that i learn by doing, not so much by reading or being told something. I am more focused when i am in a proper work environment, i tend to slack off when i am at home. i should also limit social media distractions to stay more focused. my commitment is that i will come into Dev Academy everyday in bootcamp and whenever required in foundations and when i am working i will limit distractions to break times. when i work with others i will put into practice good communication and understanding. when i need help i will first ask the appropriate slack channels if appropriate and then i will ask my faccilatator and then if that doesent work i will ask someone at Dev Academy. my only daily commitments are going to the gym and i have my brothers wedding in febuary and my sisters wedding in april so i will have to plan ahead for those.</p>
