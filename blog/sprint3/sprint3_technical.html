        <h1>Sprint 3 Technical</h1>

        <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>html is the skeleton (the structure) while css is the muscles and skin (what it looks like).</p>

        <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'. (But not those ones).</h3>
        <p>control flow is making decisions based on one or more variables so for example if a refrigerator is too hot then it will turn the cooler on. an example of loops is you have a hundred boxes and one of the boxes has a coin in it you check through each box until you find the coin.</p>

        <h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
        <p>the DOM  (Document Object Model) is how you use javascript to interact with the html and css. you could interact with it by checking if a button is pushed or not and then poping up an alert etc.</p>

        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <p>with an array you can access any piece of data from the arra=y you just need to know where it is ( e.g. myArray[0] would access the first element in an array). with an object though when you try to access data through an object you have to use the functions in the class to access the data.</p>
    

        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <p>functions are blocks of code that are meant to be reused, they have an input the perform an action on that and then outputs the result. functions can be easily called and reused sometimes in a lot of different ways.</p>
