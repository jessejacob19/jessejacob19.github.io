        <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h2>
        <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
        <p>one example is leaving university last year i was doing computer science at UC and i was really not enjoying the course, i found myself not participating with some stuff and always thinking i can learn all this stuff on my own. when i learned about dev academy i had the decision of dropping uni, working for the rest of the year and doing dev academy in 2019. i knew that going to dev academy seemed like the right option but to drop everything ive been working on was quite difficult. the consequences were working for the rest of 2018 and then coming here but no college degree.</p>
        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>being rased on a farm taught me that if you want to get somewhere in life you have to work hard, work smart, be precise in how you communicate, get to know the right people and ask the right questions.</p>

        <h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h2>
        <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
        <p>i learn from doing, that can be both a strength and a weakness. because i can get right to the point instead of wasting time trying to read up on how to solve a problem i just dive in and calibrate after the limitation of that is when somebody tells me to do something i have to focus a lot to be able to retain those instructions. One of my other strengths is i try to get to the point and communicate in a way the that specific person will understand. One of my weaknesses is sometimes i cut people off when talking to them because i have a thought that i want to get into the conversation when i should let them finish their train of thought and then reply.</p>
        <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
        <p>my learning by doing strength is quite convient because it works well with the lean as you go approach but it might not work so well if somebody tells me a set of instructions and i don't have something written to revert back to when i am working on the project.</p>
        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your       reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
        <p>In the summer i was working with my dad who does some contracting work (making hay bales) and there was a lot of resistance because he would tell me what to do then i would go and do it but get stuck or miss a few steps and we would both get frustraited but when he figured out how i learned, the whole working relationship improved significantly because he knew i had to do the job first, mess up a bit and then i would learn how to do it properly.</p>
