        <h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h3>
        <p>Recognising that your brain is always changing allows you to grasp that you can always learn new things and that your never really stagnant.</p>
        <h3>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit </h3>
        <p>You have to keep on learning and changing otherwise you get comfortable and don't change. you have to be specific about what you do and you have to practice what you do repetitively.</p>
        <h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
            Increase the ammount you are doing something, stay focused on exactly what you want to get good at. the ammout of time you spend on
             something and the ammout of effort will also increase the neuroplacicity.
