        <h1>Sprint 4 Technical</h1>
        <h2>A Time When I</h2>
        <h3>Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p>
            In this sprint i got stuck trying to hard code a function when i could be using the
             in-built method. i realised this was a real simple problem and i was overcomplicating
              it so i googled the in-built method and just used that. i felt real stupid because this
               real simple task was taking so long. i learn't that the simplest solution is usually the best.
        </p>
        <h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
        <p>
            I made a form on my webpage where you can enter your email and leave a message 
            and to make it functional i would have had to hardcode the backend for it to work but instead 
            i used a service called formspree to do it automatically. I felt very resourseful. i learn't
            that if you've thought of something somebody has probably coded it.
        </p>
        <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h3>
        <p>
            In general i can solve problems pretty well, if i get stuck i usually try something or google
             it if that is not enough i look at the error message and try to figure out what i'm doing wrong
             , then i console.log it, then i get to the point where its a real problem and i have to write out
              the steps and subdivide it or talk my way through the problem and if i still dont get it i will
               ask for help, when the problems solved i then reflect on it
        </p>
